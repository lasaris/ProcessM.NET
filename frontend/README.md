## Web Application Frontend
- In order to run and function locally the API project needs to be running on port 8080.
- Either run the frontend application by running `npm run dev` in the frontend project and then run the API (on the correct port). Or in the root directory, `docker compose up` can be run, which builds 2 docker containers and the web application can be visited on: [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081/)
